      Our article describes the proportion of deaths in Latin American cities that are attributable to
      non-optimal ambient temperatures. This app translates the
      article figures into interactive visualizations, allowing more granular
      exploration of the article analysis. Please contact

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Background: Climate change and urbanization are rapidly increasing human
      exposure to extreme ambient temperatures, yet few studies have examined
      the impact of temperature on mortality across Latin America, where 80% of
      residents live in urban areas.
      <br />
      Methods: We used distributed lag nonlinear conditional Poisson models to
      estimate city-specific associations between daily temperatures above
      (“heat”) and below (“cold”) each city-specific minimum mortality
      temperature and all-cause mortality, overall and stratified by age and
      cause of death. We estimated the percentage of total deaths attributable
      to heat or cold (excess death fraction [EDF]) and the difference in
      mortality per 1°C higher daily mean temperature above the 95th percentile
      of observed daily temperature.
      <br />
      Results: We analyzed data from 326 cities in nine Latin American countries
      between 2002-2015, representing 15,431,532 deaths. The EDF of total deaths
      from heat was 0.67% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58%, 0.74%), and from
      cold was 5.09% (95% CI 4.64%, 5.47%). EDFs from heat and cold were
      particularly high among individuals aged 65+ years (0.81% [95% CI 0.75%,
      0.86%] and 6.82% [95% CI 6.41%, 7.18%], respectively). The relative risk
      of death per 1°C increase above the city-specific 95th percentile daily
      temperature was 1.057 (95% CI 1.046, 1.067).
      <br />
      Conclusions: In Latin American cities, a substantial proportion of deaths are attributable to
      non-optimal ambient temperatures. Older populations are particularly
      vulnerable. Marginal increases in observed hot temperatures are associated
      with steep increases in mortality risk. Policy makers in these settings
      must prioritize actions to prevent present and future health risks of
      extreme temperatures.
