# Extreme temperatures and mortality in 326 Latin American cities: a longitudinal ecological study

This folder contains all the code files needed to reproduce the findings in the paper. 
The files cannot be run without the mortality data, however. The mortality data cannot be made available 
due to data use agreements with the various countries.

The file 00.0.RunGeneric.R calls in all other files needed.

All the code used here is heavily based on the code used for the analysis in the paper
   "Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature:
     a multi-country study" by Antonio Gasparrini and collaborators (The Lancet, 2015)

We downloaded their code from here: 
   https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata
and edited it as needed for our analysis.
